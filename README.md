# Stock Prediction Using LSTM

This project implements a stock prediction system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The application leverages LSTM models to predict stock prices and provides a web interface for users to select a company and view predictions.

## Project Overview

- **Stock Price Prediction:** Utilizes LSTM models to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Web Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web application to select a company and view predictions and visualizations.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the application.
